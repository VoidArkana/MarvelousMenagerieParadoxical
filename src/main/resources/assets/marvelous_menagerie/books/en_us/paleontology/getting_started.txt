    The first step to
get into the world of
paleontology is to get
yourself a good guide
that can fill you with
the knowledge you need.
Congratulations! You've
already taken that
step by reading this.

    Across the overworld,
especially underground,
you will notice that
particular deposits
of rocks are laid
across the overworld.
   Each sediment type
will represent different
eras;

    {Shale|early_paleo/index.json}
    {Siltstone|carboniferous/index.json}
    {Gabbro|permian/index.json}
    {Mudstone|triassic/index.json}
    {Limestone|jurassic/index.json}
    {Chalk|cretaceous/index.json}
    {Breccia|paleogene/index.json}
    {Diatomite|neogene/index.json}
    {Permafrost|quaternary/index.json}

    These different rocks have different resources embedded in them, and in order to get the goods trapped in their rocky prisons you'll to have to craft for yourself a trusty §lPaleontology §lKit.









    With this set of tools you will be able to
§lInteract with any fossil block to begin an excavation! Complete an excavation to uncover rewards.
