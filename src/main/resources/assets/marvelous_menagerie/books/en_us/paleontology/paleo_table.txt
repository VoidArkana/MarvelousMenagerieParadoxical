    Once our excavations have been successful and have yielded §lfossils§r, we must now identify them using a
§lPaleontology§r §lTable§r.
    This workstation will not only allow you to identify fossils, but it will also allow for villagers to go down the path of Paleontology.
    Once we have obtained a Paleontology Table the process is simple; we need to put the fossil on the table and use a brush on it.
