    Beholders are
dangerous beasts
spawning from the depths of time.
Their hard shell provides them with protection against damage and knockback.
    One must be wary of their mandibles, for they can grab any target with them and immobilize them, making them dangerous foes when other enemies are around.
    When fighting them, water is not a safe space to go to either, as they will be just as nimble as they were in land, if not more so than before.
    Upon death, there's a chance they leave behind §lChronotite§r and §lBeholder Mandibles§r. I suspect one could use these to craft things, but so far I have only been able to extract extra
Chronotite from them.
