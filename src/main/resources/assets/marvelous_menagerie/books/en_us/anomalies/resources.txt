    Many resources relating to time can be made and found.
    §lChronotite§r is a curious metal present in the bodies of time abominations, and has mysterious latent temporal properties.

    Combining it with §lOpal§r in a crafting table will allow us to create a §lChronotite§r §lWatch§r, a tool that will allow us to pinpoint a moment in time and recall
creatures from a bygone age.






    §lChronotite§r
§lPedestals§r and
§lChronotite§r §lAltars§r are blocks that will aid us in bringing creatures from the past.
    Pedestals can also be used to display items in a fanciful way.






    To open a rift in time and space, however, we will have to create a §lTemporal§r §lAltar§r, a structure which we will cover in the next chapter.
