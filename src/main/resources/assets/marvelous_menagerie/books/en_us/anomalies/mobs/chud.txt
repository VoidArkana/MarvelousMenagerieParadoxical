    The CHUD (Creature Hailing from an Unkown Dimension) was the first abomination that I discovered before I knew these monsters were time abominations, and is also the most harmless of them all.
    These horrible beings have their flesh torn asunder by the energy of the time fractures, transmuting whatever they were before into the blobs of flesh one is able to witness today.
    The only thing that these pathetic beings do with their miserable existence is walk around and roll away from people, as they seem to have somewhat of an instinct to hide their appearance, almost as if they were self-aware of their hideous looks.
    If we were so merciful as to release them from their torment, we will find ourselves with a little bit of the strange metal that coats their underside, §lChronotite§r, and a little bit of rotten flesh.
