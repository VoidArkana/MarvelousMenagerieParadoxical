    Molten are one of the stranger and more dangerous beasts that emerge from natural fractures.
    These monsters agonize in each step they take due to their bodies being mixed with molten lava, and as such their temperament is terrible.
    Their rocky exterior provides them with extra armor, while their hot interior makes them immune to fire damage and allows them to launch fireballs at their targets.
    Should one release them of their torment, they will be rewarded with bigger amounts of §lChronotite§r than other anomalies, as well as §lMolten Spines§r, which can be broken down into more Chronotite.
