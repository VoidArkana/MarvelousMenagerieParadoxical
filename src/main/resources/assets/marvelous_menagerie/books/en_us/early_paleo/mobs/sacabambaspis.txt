    Sacabambaspis is a peculiar fish with its origins being traced back to the Ordovician period, in the early Paleozoic era.
    These peculiar fish like to swim around their environment, going around with their open mouths as they lack jaws to close them, searching for anything they can eat that fits in them.




    They drop themselves upon death, their meat being able to be cooked or surrounded by gold for a special meal that other creatures seem to love eating.
