    Trilobites were a whole extinct class of arthropods that had many different shapes and sizes, coming into the scene in the Cambrian and going extinct in the late Permian.
    Because of their great diversity they can come in many different shapes and colors, making them perfect for collectors to have or simple aquarium decor.
    When killed they will usually drop more than one piece of their meat, which can be a nice source of food for other creatures.
