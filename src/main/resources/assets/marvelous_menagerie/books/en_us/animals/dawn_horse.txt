    Eohippus, commonly known as the Dawn Horse, are tiny creatures related to the ancestors of modern day horses.
    These creatures, due to their size, are unfortunately targeted by wolves and cats in the modern era, so caution must be exerted.
    Upon death, they will leave behind their §lmeat§r, which can be cooked.




    Similarly to modern horses, skeletal and zombified forms of them exist.
    §lFossil Dawn Horses§r can very rarely be found through the overworld, often found with undead riders.
    §lZombie Dawn Horses§r could theoretically be obtained if a Dawn Horse underwent
zombiefication, perhaps with the use of an
§linnovative§r §lrotten§r §lapple§r or by feeding it a disgusting meal, perhaps like the flesh of a Chud.
