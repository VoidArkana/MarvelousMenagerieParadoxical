    Arandaspis is one of the oldest vertebrates we're able to summon from the deep past, having lived in the early Ordovician.
    They lack jaws, and as such they are stuck with silly faces all the time.
    Despite not having a jaw, they had a bunch of mobile structures in their mouth that allows them to feed by sucking in food.
    These creatures come in different colors, and will love to follow one another despite the color.
