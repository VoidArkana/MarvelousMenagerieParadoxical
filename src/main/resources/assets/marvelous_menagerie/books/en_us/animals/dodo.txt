    A strange bird that called an island home, it went extinct when invaders from strange lands overtook its home, unable to fight back.
    These birds have an affinity for melons and pumpkins, and they love destroying them as a form of enrichment.
    Their plumage is so vast that every once in a while they may also drop some of their feathers, making them a good source of them.

    One can also feed them glistening melon slices to prevent them from breaking any pumpkin or melons, satiating their hunger, and if one were to want to reactivate their appetite, a reminder of how good their foods taste will set them back in motion.
