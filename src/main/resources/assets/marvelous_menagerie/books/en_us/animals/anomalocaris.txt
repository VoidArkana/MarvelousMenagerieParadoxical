    Anomalocaris was a genus of Arthropod from the Cambrian, and for a while was thought to be the very first apex predator.
    Despite early belief, Anomalocaris prefer soft prey unlike Trilobites, so they will not attack them but will eat §lTrilo Bites§r if fed by someone, making it shake with excitement and dropping a §lSclerite§r in the process.
    These Sclerites can be combined to create armor for water mounts, which can protect them from almost any kind of damage, and can be repaired with more Sclerites without having to take it off.







    Anomalocaris was also well known to have been one of the animals with the best vision ever, if not the best. When they grow up they will shed the §llenses§r in their eyes, useful ingredients for the Anomalous Goggles.
    The §lAnomalous Goggles§r can be crafted with two Anomalocaris Eye Lenses and one Anomalocaris Sclerite, providing you with greatly improved underwater vision.






    They can also be further enchanted with either §lCambrian Vision§r, which lights up darker areas underwater for even more visibility,or §lInfernal Vision§r, for better vision under the lava, these
enchantments being mutually exclusive.
