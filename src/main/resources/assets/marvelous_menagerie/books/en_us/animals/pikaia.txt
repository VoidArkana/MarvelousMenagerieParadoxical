    Pikaia is one of the earliest chordates ever discovered, living in the Cambrian period.
    They had a notochord, a structure which would eventually lead to the development of vertebral columns in all living vertebrates.
    These curious
creatures have the unique ability to rejuvenate dying coral, bringing them back to life and restoring their beautiful colors.
    But if one were to not want this then simply feeding them dried kelp will keep them from reviving any coral, a behaviour that can be enabled again by feeding them regular kelp.
