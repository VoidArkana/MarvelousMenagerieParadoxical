    Doedicurus was a Glyptodon, a family of extinct giant armadillos from South America.
    Much like armadillos, their tough exterior allows them to withstand damage, but unlike modern armadillos, Doedicurus was equipped with a mace at the end of its tail, which it will not hesitate to use against any potential threat.
