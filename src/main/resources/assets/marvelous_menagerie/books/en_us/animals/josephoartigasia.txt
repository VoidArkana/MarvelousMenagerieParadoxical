    Josephoartigasia is the largest rodent to ever live, having lived 2 to 3 million years ago in South America.
    They are closely related to the charming capybara, and much like to their close relatives these giant rodents have a very relaxed temperament, their calm energy being such as to make everything around them relax as well, making any creature that would otherwise attack others not do so, not even hostile creatures would attack the player.
    They can be tamed using apples and saddled to ride them, although they're not the fastest or strongest mount, but they can be ordered to sit around somewhere specific, and when sat they can be stood on.
