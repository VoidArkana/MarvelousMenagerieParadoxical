    Hallucigenia is a very odd organism from the mid-Cambrian that had a very enigmatic discovery story, baffling even myself, as we didn't know which way was up or down, or which way was front or back.

    We now know that it had spikes on its back to protect it from predators, with which it seems to be able to deliver a potent toxin that alters one's senses.
    When they sting, there's a small chance a little bit of extra §lmucus§r will be secreted, with which one can either brew this potent toxin into a potion or bake it into delicious snacks







that will not only allow you to go faster, but will also make everything around you look very colorful.
