    The Steller's Sea Cow was the largest sirenian in the world, even rivaling some whales in size.
    These marvelous creatures are insulated in a thick layer of blubber, which made them very sought after by sailors and eventually led to their demise, but also made them so buoyant they hang around the water's surface, allowing for one to stand on them sometimes.
    These large amounts of fat are also present in their milk, and by drinking it you can temporarily gain some of their defensive
capabilities and increased lung capacity, but if you drink the milk as it is you will find that it will make you sick due to its high fat contents.
    To mitigate the
nauseous effects, one can use the milk to instead make ice cream, spreading out the duration of the effect as a trade off.






    One can also gain the favor of the Sea Cows by swimming near them without hurting them.
    While the adults are way too massive, the babies can be
transported using buckets, although I suspect if one had a fishnet of some sorts one could transport even the massive adults.
