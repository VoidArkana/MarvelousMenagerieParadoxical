    The Thylacine, despite being thought to harm livestock and humans in the past, are quite shy and even capable of forming bonds with humans.
    As proof of their tameness, while you can't fully tame them you can decorate their necks with colorful handkerchiefs by using a colored carpet block on them, or you can remove them by using shears.
    They are also good guard dogs, as when being fed them their favorite foods, chicken or rabbit, they will howl and alert you of nearby potential threats such as hostile and neutral mobs.
