    Borealopelta are gentle giants that spend their time wandering around.
    Should one disturb them, however, they will not hesitate to deal powerful blows with their tails.
    Upon breeding, they will lay an egg on blocks such as sands, dirts, clay or gravel, and the egg  will only hatch if placed in one of those blocks.
