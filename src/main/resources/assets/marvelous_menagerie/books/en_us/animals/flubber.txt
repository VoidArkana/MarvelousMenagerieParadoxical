    Flubbers are mysterious creatures from the overworld's ancient past, living before even the time of the dinosaurs.
    These beasts used to roam ancient beaches, laying on the sand and going for a swim.
    Much like the Sniffer, the Flubber has an affinity for digging up things from the past in a mysterious manner, although it seems like flubbers much prefer animal blocks.

Flubbers will dig:
    • §lSea Pickles
    • §lDickinsonia
    • §lHerpetogaster
    • §lCharnia
    • §lWiwaxia
    One can breed them with any of these items, at which point they will find a sandy spot to lay an egg.
    Their eggs will only hatch if laid on sand.
