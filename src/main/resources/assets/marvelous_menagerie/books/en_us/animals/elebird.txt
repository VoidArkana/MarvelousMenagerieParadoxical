    Being the largest bird ever known, their eggs are amongst the largest of any living creature ever, and they can be made to lay one of them every few minutes by feeding them golden carrots, although the resulting egg will always be infertile.





    These eggs can be cooked by themselves to make a hefty meal, although when cooked they have a much better use by combining them with carrots and potatoes to make a §lJumbo
§lOmelette§r, which is an extremely fulfilling meal that can also grant a little bit of regeneration.






    When consumed or used for crafting, the cooked eggs will leave behind the strongest part of the §leggshell§r, which can then be used to craft a special helmet that thanks to its sturdy material can give you a lot of knockback resistance, as well as granting you the abilities of a bird by making you fall slowly to the ground as if you had wings, but be careful as eggshells aren't sturdy forever, and as such the §lEgg Shellmet§r has a short useful life before it breaks beyond repair.








    Elephant birds can also be equipped with §lchests§r, and thanks to their sheer size are able to carry almost as much as a singular chest, making them good options to move items with, and they're also able to be equipped with carpets of different colors to make them stand out from each other, and when one of them is leashed the others will follow suit as well, to make travelling along these wonderful beasts easier. One can also sit on their backs, but any attempt of controlling their direction has been futile so far.
