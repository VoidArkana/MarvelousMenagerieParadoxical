    Sniffers were once tamed by a bygone civilization of ancient builders, their eggs still found around some of their ruins to this day.
    These beasts use their highly specialized sense of smell to find ancient seeds and plants, how they manage to find plants from a bygone age is something that's still a mystery to myself as well, but they will be able to find many plants.

    Some of the plants they'll dig are:
    • §lTorch Flowers
    • §lPitcher Pods
    • §lCooksonia
    • §lSigillaria
    • §lCalamites
    • §lPrototaxites
    One can breed them with some of their favorite seeds, at which point they will leave an egg for someone to place.
    These eggs can be used to then summon other creatures as well, and their hatching process will be
accelerated by placing them on moss blocks.
